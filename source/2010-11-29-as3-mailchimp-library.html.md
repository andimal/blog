Since we first released the AS3 MailChimp Library we've recieved numerous comments, emails and message regarding updates, changes, errors and more. Here is the latest version of the Class and what it includes:

- Update the code to a separate class so it's easier to integrate and call the functions
- First and Last name are optional
- Data Center issues that people were running into now has a solution!

For those that previously had issues with the data center errors, we've integrated a new variable that allows you to change the data center settings so your code will work. We hope this is a great fit for now. I'd love to hear what other kind of changes and features you'd be interested in for the next release. Please use the comments to let us know your thoughts.
