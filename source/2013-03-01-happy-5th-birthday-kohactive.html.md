Five years ago kohactive began with a simple mission, build great web and mobile products for clients, ourselves and the world. Since our inception, we've grown in size, worked with some amazing clients and learned a lot while the riding the roller coaster of the interwebs.

In the last five years, we've:

- Worked on over 200 projects
- Tracked over 3 million page views
- Built over 10 internal projects and apps
- Grew the team from 2 to 7
- Written hundreds of thousands of lines of code
- Designed millions of pixels
- Launched a few iPad apps
- Contributed to the open source community
- and much more...

None of this would be possible without our amazing team. The work that Gino, Nick, Sulaiman, Lawrence and Patrick have contributed has been amazing and we're incredibly excited for 2013 and beyond.

Thank you to our wonderful clients who believe we would build the best possible products for them. We have enjoyed working with you and look forward to the next 5 years!
