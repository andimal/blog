Starting a startup is tough. Statistically, 90% of startups fail. A [compilation of startup failures by CBInsights][cb-insights-failures] reveals the majority of them never find product market fit. Some of these startups spend millions of dollars to come to this realiziation. Luckily, there is quite a bit that founders can do to validate their idea, find their market and understand their customers.

## Start With a Mission
Remember that your building a business, not an app or a website. A business should be driven by a mission that identifies its goal and strategy. A mission should be a big idea that is a guiding principle for the company, it can be as short or as long as needed. 

Airbnb's mission is short and simple: "Belong anywhere". Uber's mission is "Transporation, as reliable as running water, everywhere for everyone". Inc has compiled a [great list of startup missions statements][inc-mission-statements].

## Understand Your Business Model
A lot of startups run with an idea and build a product without understanding their business model. Just because a few friends told you that's a great idea, doesn't mean anybody would pay for it. 

A business model is a strategy for generating revenue and delivering value to your customers. It identifies your market, customers, solutions, revenue streams and much more. There are numerous tools out there to help build your business model, we prefer the [Lean Canvas][lean-canvas]. We've worked with a lot of startups that "had a great idea" but much difficulty completing their business model. Truly understanding the market and your customers is much more difficult than it appears. 

## Research
I'm always surprised by how many entreprenuers fail to do adaquate research before pursuing an idea. You don't need to hire a research firm to get an initial understanding of the market. Use the information from your business model to research your customers and competitors. 

### Market Size
Understanding your market size and growth is critical to the success of a startup. Whether the market is huge and broad or small and niche, it's important to ensure you're entering a market that is growing. 

Understanding the local market size is just as important. When a startup launches, they are not suddenly available worldwide. Instead, they begin with their local economy and then grow to other cities and countries. If you want to start a business you must be in the right place at the right time. If you're local economy isn't big enough then you're chances of survival are small. For example, if you're trying to develop a restuarant delivery service in a small suburb you're probably going to have much more trouble than a large city like New York or Chicago with more customers and demand.

### Competitive Analysis
Competition is usually a good thing. Unless you are starting an ambitious startup like space exploration, think SpaceX, then you should encounter competition. Otherwise, if you have no competition then there is a good chance that there are no customers in that market.

Competitive analysis is a great way to enhance your business model. While reviewing competitors and understanding the market, you should answer the following questions:

- Who are your competitors?
- How are you better, faster or cheaper?
- What's your unfair advantage?

Google has a few great tools for conducting simple market research:

- [Google Trends][google-trends]: what are the search trends for key items
- [Google Insights][google-insights]: break down search data by location


## Customer Development
Customer development is one of the most important aspects of finding product/market fit. Many entreprenuers underestimate the importance of it, instead they believe "if they build it, they will come". This is far from reality. You can't build a successful product without the help of your customers.

Customer development is the process of identifying, interviewing and understanding your customers, their pains and their needs. In order to build a product, an entreprenuer must understand what the _right_ product is. How do you do this?

1. **Find your potential customers**: Goto meetups, find them on social networks, get introductions from friends, search your network.
2. **Talk to your potential customers**: Setup a meeting, lunch or drinks to sit down and get a deep understanding of their needs.
3. **Identify Pains and Needs**: Get an idea of their pain points and what their needs are. Try to extract as much detail as possible.
4. **Notes**: Take notes, lots of notes. 

People love to talk, especially when somebody is listening. Learn to become a good listener and you'll both enjoy the experience. 

Customer development is a great way to identify what kind of product you must build to find a product/market fit. Likewise, you can even find your first customers. The people that take time to talk to you will be even more vested in your idea as they feel that they are part of something big.
