One of the first lessons learned when launching a startup is that you can’t do it alone. And while we have seen some founders proudly try to make a go of it without much help, it’s the folks who surround themselves with industry guidance, wisdom, and support that tend to come out on top. 

The Chicago startup world is booming with competition and innovation right now, and joining some of these organizations is a surefire way to make a meaningful and, most importantly, lasting splash.

1871 constantly offers companies a chance to have their product or idea nurtured by tech veterans. It isn’t just for startup noobs, though. Many of their peer-to-peer style programs will appeal to even the most hardened tech entrepreneur, as evidenced by the success of their Bunker Labs, which is built "by veteran entrepreneurs for veteran entrepreneurs."

## <a href="http://ms-tech.co" target="_blank">Ms. Tech</a>
Ms. Tech’s mission statement includes a sobering reality of the industry: Less than 3% of venture capital funding goes to startups led by women. We believe this has to change, which is one of the many reasons why we applaud Ms. Tech’s tireless commitment to changing the status quo, and why we encourage all tech founders to give them a look. First class membership includes monthly "Masterminds," which are sessions on important topics such as innovation, accountability, and self-management. Sessions are led by industry vets, and provide valuable interaction with other driven entrepreneurs.
