Blogging is one of the most important social media channels available to any business. It’s great because it’s free and it’s easy to do. The only problem is that most people have no idea what to blog about. My response to all clients is the same: Blog about your industry and what you know about it.  Here at kohactive we blog about technology, web development, social media and our iphones. Note that we blog about what we know and do. And not only that, but blogging has made us money and it can absolutely do the same for you.

Calm down, I know you’re getting excited but I need to set up the situation. A few months ago I was looking for a solution to a problem with regards to [Flash Web Development and MailChimp](http://www.kohactive.com/blog/as3-mailchimp-library/) Integration and when I couldn’t find the answer I decided to develop my own. After a few hours of hard work I solved my problem and then wrote a blog about it. I didn’t just write about the problem, I provided a solution and source code available for download.

At the time, I didn’t realize how many other people were looking for the same solution. Without knowing this I went ahead and notified MailChimp about my supreme accomplishment and then immediately posted a link to the article on their website. That was HUGE! One of the largest and most popular Email Marketing company in the world had posted a link to our blog on their website. They did it because it provided solutions for their clients and it was resourceful. It was mutually beneficial.

Over the course of a few months I saw thousands of visitors searching and finding that article. We had thousands of hits and everyone seemed happy. One day a London based company approached us about the code. They thanked us and asked if we were “experts in flash”. Consequently, they hired us for a project, which will inevitably lead to future projects. We plan on maintaining a close and personal relationship with this company.

This is just a small example of many companies and bloggers who have gained business leads and clients through blogging. How does this effect you? it’s quite simple. If you want a blog that matters than you should follow these simple rules:

1. Blog about what you know and do
2. Don’t just talk, provide solutions or answers
3. Provide insight and knowledge to beginners or other industry professionals
4. Always maintain professionalism and integrity
5. Always site sources (if applicable)
6. Use Twitter and Facebook to spread the word
7. Share with our industry professionals or related businesses

Now these simple rules are not going to help every business succeed, but I believe that giving will always provide a return of some sort. Don’t be hesitant to give out “secrets”, unless that secret makes billions of dollars.
