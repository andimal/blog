_This is a follow up to another article. If you're interested in the the benefits of User Testing, ![check out the article](https://www.kohactive.com/blog/user-testing-what-it-is-and-why-you-should-do-it/)_

Last year we built an SMS-based photo sharing app called memms during an internal hackathon. 

Once the core app was working, we built a basic onboarding flow for new users. We showed a few users and watched them go through the flow without any prompting. On the first touch point, each user asked the same questions about the input that prompted them for a phone number: "Is this my phone number or the one I'll be texting?"

Memms is SMS based. A user would text message their photos to a number and they would be shared with other participants of the event. It's not weird that they would ask this. When we designed the flows, this wasn't a point of confusion at all. But when real users started to use the app, they geniunely were confused. We changed the text prompt to say "Your mobile phone number". 

What if we didn't show any users and just launched the product. How many users would have been confused and lost interest when things didn't work out?

While this is a fairly simplified example of user testing, it goes to show you affective basic testing can be. 

User Testing isn't a new concept. In fact, it's <a href="http://www.thehumanfactorblog.com/2009/01/06/a-short-history-of-human-factors-and-ergonomics/" target="_blank">been around since World War II</a>. They didn't have touch screens back then, it was mostly machinary.


## User Testing Techniques

There are various user tests that you can conduct in order to gain insights into a specific problem. Regardless of the test, there are three ways to conduct a test:

- **Moderated**: A method in which a moderator is present to facilitate the test (this can be done remotely as well). During this type of test, the moderator can follow up and interact with the subject.

- **Unmoderated**: No facilitator is present and the user only has instructions to follow in order to complete the test. This is a good way to collect a lot of data quickly without much overhead.

Deciding which is best for you will depend on the objective. While unmoderated tests are much easier to perform, you will typically learn much more through an open dialog of a moderated test. Also, the type of test you are performing will help you determine the needs.

- Problem discovery
- Benchmark
- Five second test
- Preference test
- Competitive

### Problem Discovery
Problem discovery tests are the most common type of usability test. These are very simple to conduct both moderated and unmoderated. During a problem discovery test, users are asked to perform a task in order to expose any problems or bottlenecks. A task could be signing up for an account, purchasing a product or some core feature of your product.

These tests are very easy to perform. There are some great products out there to help facilitate problem discovery tests with real users. With some products you simply instruct users to complete a task and get feedback through a report while other products offer videos of the users thinking outloud as they use your product.

### Benchmark
A benchmark test allows you to test your results over time. The first wholistic benchmark test gives you the baseline usability of your product. After every marjor release or feature launch, you can conduct a usability test to compare with your previous benchmark. 

### Five-second test
Five-second tests are a great way to gain insights into your landing page. During the test, a user is presented with a design for five-seconds then asked a what they remember. User's only <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-long-do-users-stay-on-web-pages/" target="_blank">spend about 10-20 seconds</a> before leaving your website, so optimization is vital. A five-second test allows you to validate whether your value proposition sticks, whether users understand what you're selling and if they remember your brand.

### Preference Test
Not only are preference tests a great way to settle internal debates, but a simple way to predict which design will perform better. A preference test, as the name illicits, it's a simple test where a subject is present two options and selects the one they like best. A preference test can be moderated or unmoderated. Using tools like UsabilityHub, you can easily create and share preference tests. 

### Competitive Test
If you have direct competitors in your market, you should always conduct a competitive usability test. If you haven't started building your product yet then you can conduct a Problem Discovery test on another website to find bottlenecks in competitor products. If you have a product, you can run tests against multiple competitors to see how you stake up. Competitive tests can be holistic--testing the entire product--or focused on a specific feature or function.



## When Should You User Test

Always. I'm kidding. But not really. You should incorporate user testing into your process. If you look at methodologies like the Lean Startup, you'll see that user validation is a core componenet of the Build, Measure, Learn process. This is because user testing is key to ensuring we're building products and services that solve problems for real users. Whether you're a one-person startup or a billion dollar company, including user testing into your process will improve your output and bottom line.

User testing should become a habit. A habit that you implement at any stage of your process. Whether you are building a new product or redesigning a feature, you can always user test. Here is an overview of some good points to start testing:

- discovery phase
- strategy phase
- ux/design
- beta/launch

### Discovery Phase
When you've identified a potential problem that requires a solution, it's always good to start by doing some very basic user testing. Discovery phase testing should be simple and high level. What is the most minimal prototype you could create to conduct a user interview. Many time, you can mock something up in Keynote or Powerpoint and present it to a potential customer to gain a lot of feedback. Occasionally, you can even test a competitors product during the discovery phase to compare and gain insights.

Discovery phase user testing, if done right, should address quite a bit of uncertainty in your product or service. Are you building the right product? Do users understand it? Do they want it? These are all questions that discovery phase testing will answer. This initial step of testing could save you a lot of money and headaches down the road.

### Strategy Phase
User testing during the strategy phase will enable you to answer big questions about the solutions you are building. If you have multiple solutions then you can conduct user interviews to compare and learn which is t best solution.

Creating various prototypes to test during this phase is crucial. These can be low-fidelity mockups or wireframes, as long as a user can meaningfully engage in the product and provide insights into what the experience would be like.

### UX & Design
Once you've validated your idea and solution, designing a great experience is key. Working with a designer, you can create high-fidelity wireframes and conduct various user tests. This is a great opportunity to conduct in-person moderated problem discovey tests. While discovery and strategy phase testing can expose many issues, high-fidelity user testing will be the the closets the user will get to the real product. You can even conduct unmoderated user tests where subjects talk outloud and provide video of their experience.

If you can, I recommend conducting user tests after wireframing and well as design. If I had to pick one, I'd say wireframes.

### Beta & Launch
Whether you have a beta period or just do it live, it's always important to conduct a user test of the product. While all of the other tests are based on prototypes and mockups, this phase of testing allows us to watch users actually _use_ our product. This is the phase where variable change comes into play. How does internet bandwidth affect the app? How about screen size? How about the speed of the app? In-person moderated tests as well as platform based tests are great for this phase. 




## Platforms
There are quite a bit of platforms for user testing availble, each of which different in features and services. 

### Platform Name

### UserTesting
UserTesting is one of the most popular platforms around. It's based on a "think out loud" technique where users record themselves testing your app and talking about their experience, expectations and providing feedback.

UserTesting is pretty powerful. The dashboard allows you to breakdown the results of each task including speed and difficult. You can benchmark each round of tests against the previous tests.

UserTesting is great for testing beta and prototypes that actually function. While you could test a clickable prototype or landing page, it's best served for getting feedback from users that can interact with a real application. You can even provide the tester with a few instructions like "find a pair of shoes and purchase it" or "sign up and create your profile".

UserTesting costs $49 per video up to 10 and $99 per video following that. For only a few videos, those numbers could add up quickly. But if you're looking for high quality feedback then UserTesting is great option.

### UserBrain
UserBrain is another platform that provides "think out loud" feedback from users. They focus primarily on websites and web-based applications, rather than mobile apps. 

Unlike other platform, UserBrain sends you weekly (or monthly) videos of users testing out your website. The goal is to make user testing an ongoing part of your process--and this could be very powerful if you are changing your site frequently. UserBrain requires real websites that are available to a tester, so mockup and prototype testing is not an option.

UserBrain pricing varies. It cost $49 a month one video a week and $139 a month for 3 videos per week. There is a cheaper option at $29 a month for a single video each month.




### UserThink
UserThink is focused primarily on testing landing pages. 

They support live websites as well as prototypes and mockups.
