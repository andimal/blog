Many companies come to us with no idea of what they want their website design to look like. We run through an exercise with most clients with the goal of extracting a design style that fits with what they're trying to express about their company. But we always remind clients: design, colors, and logos can (and should) evolve over time. Take a look at these companies and entities, and check out how their websites have evolved.

## Uber
Before Uber's recent redesign, there were several other versions of the website. Look how the site has evolved from looking like a local limo company to the current site of a  multi-billion dollar giant that has virtually changed how the world sees transit.

Before “uber” was “Uber”--we're hoping this company got a lot of money for the web address!

When Uber existed solely in the Bay area, the site had a local-limo company feel to its design.

The company is now a billion dollar brand, extending into all corners of the globe.

Today's iteration of uber is multi-color, hosts video, and pushes to be transportation for everyone, everywhere.

## Amazon

This one is interesting. Sometimes you find an aesthetic that works early on. Sure there have been some changes and updates, but overall, the site has the same look and feel today as it did in 2000.


<div><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mediocre-production/uploads/image/filename/54/amazon-may-6-2000.png" alt="Amazon.com in 2000" /></div>

Sure, there have been a lot of updates to Amazon.com since this design was captured in May, 2000. But think about how the internet has changed in 16 years--this design still feels like the Amazon we know and love today.

See? Not so different.

## Yahoo

This site has gone through so many changes. We talked about Yahoo in a previous blog about rebranding--the website has seen as many changes as the logo. For the most part, the site has improved immensely with each redesign.


<div><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mediocre-production/uploads/image/filename/56/yahoo-mar-30-1997.png" alt="Yahoo.com in 2016" /></div>

We don’t remember thinking Yahoo.com was a mess in 1997--but looking back, this screen shot certainly dates the early search engine and news site.

<div><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mediocre-production/uploads/image/filename/57/yahoo-2016.png" alt="Yahoo.com in 2016" /></div>

Considering there is a college freshman age-spread between these two screen-shots, there isn’t a vast improvement. Still void of brand personality, and trying to be too much--and too little--all at one time.

## Craigslist

Another example of "if it works, don’t fix it." Craigslist.com has never tried to portray themselves as anything other than what they are--online classifieds. The website is built purely for functionality. They have certainly made some improvements to the UI, but overall the site has remained the same.

<div><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mediocre-production/uploads/image/filename/58/Craigslist-may-20-2000.png" alt="Amazon.com in 2016" /></div>

<div><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mediocre-production/uploads/image/filename/59/craigslist-2016.png" alt="Amazon.com in 2016" /></div>

Whether you think it’s a good or a bad thing, there are very few differences here--given the 16-year time difference.

## Whitehouse.gov

This one goes back to when the internet was just making its way into government and websites served as more of an online database or catelogue than a way to share information. 

<div><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mediocre-production/uploads/image/filename/60/whitehouse.gov-apr-12-1997.png" alt="Whitehouse.giv in 1997" /></div>

This image conjures memories of a card catalogue.

<div><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mediocre-production/uploads/image/filename/61/whitehouse.gov-2016.png" alt="Whitehouse.giv in 1997" /></div>

With clean navigation and great use of simple messaging through images and video, this is an excellent example of a website as a communication tool.

## City of Chicago

Locals may or may not remember this version of the City of Chicago site from 2004. We’re hoping you don’t. Just a fun example of what local municipalities deemed quality web design in the early 2000s.

<div><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mediocre-production/uploads/image/filename/62/City-of-chicago-aug-4-2004.png" alt="City of Chicago website in 2004" /></div>

This image of the City of Chicago’s website from 12 years ago was standard for the time--and looks like an average small municipality’s website today.

<div><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mediocre-production/uploads/image/filename/63/City-of-chicago-2016.png" alt="City of Chicago website in 2004" /></div>

Fitting all of the information and messaging into a city website is hard. Cityofchicago.org actually has a pretty good layout and design to optimize communication of important news, and ease of finding important municipality information.
