Here's a simple overview on how to play FLV files on the Official VLC for iPad app.

1. Download VLC for iPad from app store free
2. Plug iPad into itunes, Select iPad, goto Apps Tab, Scroll to bottom (File Sharing).
3. Select VLC
4. Click add. Locate any flv files you want to transfer and rename them to end in .AVI
5. Add them.
6. Open VLC and enjoy FLV on iPad. (Seems a bit more choppy than the XVID movies i tried which went really smooth.)

Pretty simple, right?
